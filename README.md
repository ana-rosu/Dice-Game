# Dice-Game ðŸŽ²

This is a small project where my main objective was to apply learning of DOM and Event Listeners fundamentals in practice.
Concept from Jonas Schmedtmann.

## How to play the game?
The game has 2 players, playing in turn. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wants. Each result gets added to his current score for that turn.
If the player rolls a 1, all his current score gets lost and it's the next player's turn.
The player must click on 'Hold' before he rolls a 1. This way his current score gets added to his GLOBAL score and then it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
